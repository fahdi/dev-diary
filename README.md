A hobby project. The idea is to be able to create a dev diary where one can send a message to diary where it's stored in a timestamp. 

A project in Django REST framework to create a dev diary for myself. The idea to be able to post a development diary item throughout the day and then at the end of the day, being able to review what was done.
